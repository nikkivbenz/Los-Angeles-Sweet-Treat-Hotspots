## How to Use

### Option 1: Local HTTP Server (Recommended)
Due to browser security restrictions, you need to run a local server to load the CSV data:

1. **Using Python (if installed)**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Los-Angeles-Sweet-Treat-Hotspots
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open: http://localhost:8000

2. **Using Node.js (if installed)**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Los-Angeles-Sweet-Treat-Hotspots
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Using VS Code Live Server**: Install the Live Server extension and right-click `index.html` â†’ "Open with Live Server"

### Option 2: Direct File Access
Simply open `index.html` in your browser, but CSV loading may be blocked by CORS policy.
